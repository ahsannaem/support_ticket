Hi there,

Thanks for reaching out! I'm so sorry to hear a dragon ate your invoice and your billing history seems to be missing. That definitely sounds frustrating!

While I can't directly retrieve your billing history from here, I can certainly point you in the right direction to get this resolved.

Based on the information you provided, it sounds like you might also be experiencing some issues with multiple charges or an overcharge on your subscription. To help us investigate this properly and get your billing history restored, could you please provide the following information:

*   **Your Account ID:** This will help us quickly locate your account.
*   **Transaction Details:** Any information you have about the charges in question, such as dates and amounts, will be very helpful.

Once we have this information, we can review your billing logs for any discrepancies, such as duplicate charges or overcharges. If we find any errors, we can then guide you through the process of requesting a refund or billing adjustment.

You can reply directly to this email with the requested information. We're here to help get this sorted out for you!

Best regards,

The Support Team
